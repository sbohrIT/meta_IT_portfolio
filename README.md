# meta_IT_portfolio
Portfolio of self started projects I've created while working at Meta (formerly facebook).

***These projects are not implemented in production at Meta and contain no sensitive or confidential information.***

These where self started attempts to automate procedures or solve problems facing Enterprise Engineering/Helpdesk from 11/2019 - 5/2023.

Though these did not land, these projects highlight my ability to:
1. Identify a problem an organization is facing or a procedure that could be improved upon.
2. Use my technical skillset to develop creative solutions to these problems using code.


Languages:
- Python
- AppleScript
- Bash Scripting
